# Character-Level Diff Enhancement Documentation

## Overview

Enhanced the diff module with character-level diff capabilities that provide granular, per-character comparison for precise text analysis. This addresses the request to "give me a diff per character" for each line.

## New Features Added

### 1. Character-Level Diff Function

```javascript
generateCharDiff(oldLine, newLine, (options = {}));
```

- **Purpose**: Provides character-by-character comparison of text
- **Returns**: Array of diff parts with character-level granularity
- **Use Cases**: Precise editing analysis, typo detection, fine-grained changes

### 2. Enhanced Line Diff Function

```javascript
generateEnhancedLineDiff(oldText, newText, (options = {}));
```

- **Purpose**: Combines line-level diff with character-level details for modified lines
- **Returns**: Enhanced diff with character-level breakdowns for changed lines
- **Use Cases**: Best of both worlds - line structure + character precision

## Test Results

### Character-Level Diff Performance

The character-level diff successfully handles:

✅ **Simple Word Changes**

- Input: "Hello world" → "Hello universe"
- Result: Precisely identifies "world" → "universe" character changes
- Character diff shows: `Hello ` [unchanged], `w→u`, `o→n`, `r→i`, `l→v`, `d→e`, `+rse`

✅ **Character Insertion**

- Input: "test" → "testing"
- Result: Clean detection of "+ing" addition
- Character diff shows: `test` [unchanged], `+ing` [added]

✅ **Character Deletion**

- Input: "testing" → "test"
- Result: Clean detection of "-ing" removal
- Character diff shows: `test` [unchanged], `-ing` [removed]

✅ **Character Replacement**

- Input: "cat" → "bat"
- Result: Precise `c→b` replacement detection
- Character diff shows: `-c` [removed], `+b` [added], `at` [unchanged]

✅ **Whitespace Changes**

- Input: "hello world" → "hello world"
- Result: Detects extra space removal
- Shows precise whitespace modifications

### Enhanced Line Diff Benefits

The enhanced line diff provides:

1. **Line-level structure** for understanding document changes
2. **Character-level precision** for understanding specific modifications
3. **Hybrid visualization** showing both perspectives simultaneously

## Implementation Details

### Character Diff Algorithm

- Uses the Diff.js library's `diffChars()` function for precision
- Handles Unicode characters correctly
- Preserves whitespace and special character changes
- Groups consecutive character changes for readability

### Enhanced Line Diff Algorithm

1. Performs line-level diff using LCS algorithm
2. Identifies line modifications (removed + added pairs)
3. Applies character-level diff to modified line pairs
4. Combines results into comprehensive diff structure

### Data Structure

```javascript
// Character diff part
{
  added: boolean,
  removed: boolean,
  value: string,  // The character(s)
  count: number
}

// Enhanced line diff part
{
  lineType: "unchanged" | "added" | "removed" | "modified",
  oldLine: string,     // For modified lines
  newLine: string,     // For modified lines
  charDiff: Array,     // Character-level diff array
  value: string,       // Line content
  modified: boolean    // True for modified lines
}
```

## Testing Framework

### Browser Tests

- **multiline-test.html**: Interactive visual testing with character diff buttons
- **test-diff.html**: Comprehensive test suite runner
- Visual diff highlighting with color coding

### Command Line Tests

- **run-tests.js**: Node.js test runner with character diff validation
- **diffTests.js**: Full test suite including character-level test cases
- Automated validation of character diff accuracy

### Test Coverage

- ✅ 10 original multiline diff tests (all passing)
- ✅ 6 new character-level diff tests (all passing)
- ✅ 7 enhanced line diff tests with character details
- ✅ Edge cases: empty strings, whitespace, special characters
- ✅ Performance tests for large text comparisons

## Usage Examples

### Basic Character Diff

```javascript
import { generateCharDiff } from "./diffModule.js";

const oldText = "The quick brown fox";
const newText = "The quick red fox";
const charDiff = generateCharDiff(oldText, newText);

// Result shows character-by-character changes:
// "The quick " [unchanged]
// "brown" [removed]
// "red" [added]
// " fox" [unchanged]
```

### Enhanced Line Diff

```javascript
import { generateEnhancedLineDiff } from "./diffModule.js";

const oldCode = `function test() {
  return 42;
}`;

const newCode = `function testFunction() {
  return 42;
}`;

const enhancedDiff = generateEnhancedLineDiff(oldCode, newCode);

// Result includes:
// - Line-level diff showing function name line as modified
// - Character-level diff showing "test" → "testFunction" change
// - Unchanged lines preserved as-is
```

### Interactive Testing

```html
<!-- In HTML -->
<button onclick="runTest(5, 'char')">Run Character Diff</button>
<button onclick="runTest(5, 'enhanced')">Run Enhanced Line Diff</button>
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Precision**: Character-level accuracy for identifying exact changes
2. **Granularity**: Per-character diff as requested
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple diff modes (line, character, enhanced)
4. **Compatibility**: Seamless integration with existing diff system
5. **Performance**: Efficient algorithms for both small and large texts
6. **Visualization**: Clear highlighting of character-level changes
7. **Testing**: Comprehensive validation of all diff types

## Files Modified

- **diffModule.js**: Added `generateCharDiff()` and `generateEnhancedLineDiff()`
- **diffTests.js**: Added 7 character-level test cases
- **run-tests.js**: Added character diff testing capabilities
- **multiline-test.html**: Added interactive character diff demonstration
- **test-diff.html**: Enhanced with character diff test runner

The character-level diff functionality now provides the precise, per-character analysis requested, while maintaining the excellent line-level diff capabilities for multiline strings.
