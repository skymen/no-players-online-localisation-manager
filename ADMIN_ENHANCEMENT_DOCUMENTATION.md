## Overview

Enhanced the admin interface (`admin.html` and `admin.js`) to utilize the new character-level diff functionality, providing users with multiple visualization options for text changes.

## New Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Diff Mode Controls

The admin interface now includes multiple diff viewing modes:

- **üìã Split View**: Side-by-side comparison (existing feature)

### 2. Intelligent Mode Selection

- **Multiline Text**: Shows Standard and Enhanced modes
- **Single-line Text**: Shows Standard and Character modes
- **Automatic Detection**: Detects content type and shows appropriate options

### 3. Visual Improvements

#### Enhanced Diff Display

}
```

### HTML Interface Updates

  </button>
  <button class="diff-mode-btn" onclick="showDiffMode(index, 'enhanced')">
    üîç Enhanced
